Cryptomeria japonica is a major forestry tree species in Japan. Male sterility of
the species is caused by a recessive gene, which shows dysfunction of pollen
development and results in no dispersed pollen. Because the pollen of C. japonica
induces pollinosis, breeding of pollen-free C. japonica is desired. In this
study, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers located at 1.78 and 0.58 cM
to a male sterility locus (MS1) were identified from an analysis of RNA-Seq and
RAD-Seq, respectively. SNPs closely linked to MS1 were first scanned by a method 
similar to MutMap, where a type of index was calculated to measure the strength
of the linkage between a marker sequence and MS1. Linkage analysis of selected
SNP markers confirmed a higher efficiency of the current method to construct a
partial map around MS1. Allele-specific PCR primer pair for the most closely
linked SNP with MS1 was developed as a codominant marker, and visualization of
the PCR products on an agarose gel enabled rapid screening of male sterile C.
japonica. The allele-specific primers developed in this study would be useful for
establishing the selection of male sterile C. japonica.

The genetic basis of selection for geographic adaptation and how it has
contributed to population structure are unknown in tossa jute (Corchorus
olitorius), an important bast fibre crop. We performed restriction
site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing-based (1115 RAD-SNPs) population genomic
analyses to investigate genetic differentiation and population structure within a
collection of 221 fibre-type lines from across nine geographic regions of the
world. Indian populations, with relatively higher overall diversity, were
significantly differentiated (based on FST and PCA) from the African and the
other Asian populations. There is strong evidence that African C. olitorius was
first introduced in peninsular India that could perhaps be its secondary centre
of origin. However, multiple later introductions have occurred in central,
eastern and northern India. Based on four assignment tests with different
statistical bases, we infer that two ancestral subpopulations (African and
Indian) structure the C. olitorius populations, but not in accordance with their 
geographic origins and patterns of diversity. Our results advocate recent
migration of C. olitorius through introduction and germplasm exchange across
geographical boundaries. We argue that high intraspecific genetic admixture could
be associated with increased genetic variance within Indian populations.
Employing both subpopulation (FST/GST-outlier) and individual-based (PCAdapt)
tests, we detected putative RAD-SNP loci under selection and demonstrated that
bast fibre production was an artificial, while abiotic and biotic stresses were
natural selection pressures in C. olitorius adaptation. By reinferring the
population structure without outlier loci, we propose ad interim that C.
olitorius was possibly domesticated as a fibre crop in the Indian subcontinent.

BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are important components that confer upon tea plants a
unique flavour and health functions. However, the traditional breeding method for
selecting a cultivar with a high or unique flavonoid content is time consuming
and labour intensive. High-density genetic map construction associated with
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping provides an effective way to facilitate
trait improvement in plant breeding. In this study, an F1 population (LJ43×BHZ)
was genotyped using 2b-restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing to
obtain massive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to construct a
high-density genetic map for a tea plant. Furthermore, QTLs related to flavonoids
were identified using our new genetic map.
RESULTS: A total of 13,446 polymorphic SNP markers were developed using 2b-RAD
sequencing, and 4,463 of these markers were available for constructing the
genetic linkage map. A 1,678.52-cM high-density map at an average interval of
0.40 cM with 4,217 markers, including 427 frameset simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
and 3,800 novel SNPs, mapped into 15 linkage groups was successfully constructed.
After QTL analysis, a total of 27 QTLs related to flavonoids or caffeine content 
(CAF) were mapped to 8 different linkage groups, LG01, LG03, LG06, LG08, LG10,
LG11, LG12, and LG13, with an LOD from 3.14 to 39.54, constituting 7.5% to 42.8% 
of the phenotypic variation.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the highest density genetic map ever reported was 
constructed since the largest mapping population of tea plants was adopted in
present study. Moreover, novel QTLs related to flavonoids and CAF were identified
based on the new high-density genetic map. In addition, two markers were located 
in candidate genes that may be involved in flavonoid metabolism. The present
study provides valuable information for gene discovery, marker-assisted selection
breeding and map-based cloning for functional genes that are related to flavonoid
content in tea plants.

BACKGROUND: The process of crop domestication has long been a major area of
research to gain insights into the history of human civilization and to
understand the process of evolution. Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) is one
of the typical subtropical fruit trees, which was domesticated in China at least 
2000 years ago. In the present study, we re-sequenced the genome of nine wild
loquat accessions collected from wide geographical range and 10 representative
cultivated loquat cultivars by using RAD-tag tacit to exploit the molecular
footprints of domestication.
RESULTS: We obtained 26.4 Gb clean sequencing data from 19 loquat accessions,
with an average of 32.64 M reads per genotype. We identified more than 80,000
SNPs distributed throughout the loquat genome. The SNP density and numbers were
slightly higher in the wild loquat populations than that in the cultivated
populations. All cultivars were clustered together by structure, phylogenetic and
PCA analyses.
CONCLUSION: The modern loquat cultivars have experienced a non-significant
genetic bottleneck during domestication, and originated from a single
domesticated event. Moreover, our study revealed that Hubei province of China is 
probably the origin center of cultivated loquat.

Whole-genome comparisons of Vitis vinifera subsp. sativa and V. vinifera subsp.
sylvestris are expected to provide a better estimate of the valuable genetic
diversity still present in grapevine, and help to reconstruct the evolutionary
history of a major crop worldwide. To this aim, the increase of molecular marker 
density across the grapevine genome is fundamental. Here we describe the SNP
discovery in a grapevine germplasm collection of 51 cultivars and 44 wild
accessions through a novel protocol of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD)
sequencing. By resequencing 1.1% of the grapevine genome at a high coverage, we
recovered 34K BamHI unique restriction sites, of which 6.8% were absent in the
'PN40024' reference genome. Moreover, we identified 37,748 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), 93% of which belonged to the 19 assembled chromosomes with 
an average of 1.8K SNPs per chromosome. Nearly half of the SNPs fell in genic
regions mostly assigned to the functional categories of metabolism and
regulation, whereas some nonsynonymous variants were identified in genes related 
with the detection and response to environmental stimuli. SNP validation was
carried-out, showing the ability of RAD-seq to accurately determine genotypes in 
a highly heterozygous species. To test the usefulness of our SNP panel, the main 
diversity statistics were evaluated, highlighting how the wild grapevine retained
less genetic variability than the cultivated form. Furthermore, the analysis of
Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) in the two subspecies separately revealed how the LD 
decays faster within the domesticated grapevine compared to its wild relative.
Being the first application of RAD-seq in a diverse grapevine germplasm
collection, our approach holds great promise for exploiting the genetic resources
available in one of the most economically important fruit crops.

BACKGROUND: The excessive and uncontrolled use of anthelmintics, e.g. ivermectin 
(IVM) for the treatment of livestock parasites has led to widespread resistance
in gastrointestinal nematodes, such as Haemonchus contortus. There is an urgent
need for better management of drug-use in nematode control and development of
novel anthelmintics. Discovery and identification of anthelmintic
resistance-associate molecules/markers can provide a basis for rational
anthelmintics-use and development of novel drugs. Recent studies have shown that 
ivermectin resistance in H. contortus is likely to be multi-genic in nature
except for several genes coding for IVM target and efflux pump. However, no other
IVM resistance-associated genes were characterized by conventional methods or
strategies. In the present study we adopted a new strategy, i.e. using
genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis based on 2b-RAD
sequencing, for discovering SNPs markers across the genomes in both IVM
susceptible and resistant isolates of H. contortus and identifying potential IVM 
resistance-associated genes.
RESULTS: We discovered 2962 and 2667 SNPs within both susceptible and resistant
strains of H. contortus, respectively. A relative lower and similar genetic
variations were observed within both resistant and susceptible strains (average π
values were equal to 0.1883 and 0.1953, respectively); whereas a high genetic
variation was found across both strains (average π value was equal to 0.3899). A 
significant differentiation across 2b-RAD tags nucleotide sites was also observed
between the two strains (average FST value was equal to 0.3076); the larger
differences in average FST were observed at SNPs loci between coding and
noncoding (including intronic) regions. Comparison between resistant and
susceptible strains revealed that 208 SNPs loci exhibited significantly elevated 
FST values, 24 SNPs of those loci were located in the CDS regions of the nine
genes and were likely to have signature of IVM directional selection. Seven of
the nine candidate genes were predicted to code for some functional proteins such
as potential IVM target and/or efflux pump proteins, component proteins of
receptor complex in membrane on neuromuscular cells, and transcriptional
regulation proteins. Those genes might be involved in resistance to IVM.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that candidate genes putatively associated with
resistance to IVM in H. contortus may be identified by genome-wide SNP analysis
using 2b-RAD sequencing.

Dolphinfish is an important fish species for both commercial and sport fishing,
but so far limited information is available on genetic variability and pattern of
differentiation of dolphinfish populations in the Mediterranean basin. Recently
developed techniques allow genome-wide identification of genetic markers for
better understanding of population structure in species with limited genome
information. Using restriction-site associated DNA analysis we successfully
genotyped 140 individuals of dolphinfish from eight locations in the
Mediterranean Sea at 3324 SNP loci. We identified 311 sex-related loci that were 
used to assess sex-ratio in dolphinfish populations. In addition, we identified a
weak signature of genetic differentiation of the population closer to Gibraltar
Strait in comparison to other Mediterranean populations, which might be related
to introgression of individuals from Atlantic. No further genetic differentiation
could be detected in the other populations sampled, as expected considering the
known highly mobility of the species. The results obtained improve our knowledge 
of the species and can help managing dolphinfish stock in the future.

Restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and related methods are
revolutionizing the field of population genomics in nonmodel organisms as they
allow generating an unprecedented number of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) even when no genomic information is available. Yet, RAD-seq data analyses 
rely on assumptions on nature and number of nucleotide variants present in a
single locus, the choice of which may lead to an under- or overestimated number
of SNPs and/or to incorrectly called genotypes. Using the Atlantic mackerel
(Scomber scombrus L.) and a close relative, the Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber
colias), as case study, here we explore the sensitivity of population structure
inferences to two crucial aspects in RAD-seq data analysis: the maximum number of
mismatches allowed to merge reads into a locus and the relatedness of the
individuals used for genotype calling and SNP selection. Our study resolves the
population structure of the Atlantic mackerel, but, most importantly, provides
insights into the effects of alternative RAD-seq data analysis strategies on
population structure inferences that are directly applicable to other species.

Researchers have made great advances into the development and application of
genomic approaches for common beans, creating opportunities to driving more real 
and applicable strategies for sustainable management of the genetic resource
towards plant breeding. This work provides useful polymorphic single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) for high-throughput common bean genotyping developed by RAD 
(restriction site-associated DNA) sequencing. The RAD tags were generated from
DNA pooled from 12 common bean genotypes, including breeding lines of different
gene pools and market classes. The aligned sequences identified 23,748 putative
RAD-SNPs, of which 3357 were adequate for genotyping; 1032 RAD-SNPs with the
highest ADT (assay design tool) score are presented in this article. The RAD-SNPs
were structurally annotated in different coding (47.00 %) and non-coding
(53.00 %) sequence components of genes. A subset of 384 RAD-SNPs with broad
genome distribution was used to genotype a diverse panel of 95 common bean
germplasms and revealed a successful amplification rate of 96.6 %, showing 73 %
of polymorphic SNPs within the Andean group and 83 % in the Mesoamerican group. A
slightly increased He (0.161, n = 21) value was estimated for the Andean gene
pool, compared to the Mesoamerican group (0.156, n = 74). For the linkage
disequilibrium (LD) analysis, from a group of 580 SNPs (289 RAD-SNPs and 291
BARC-SNPs) genotyped for the same set of genotypes, 70.2 % were in LD, decreasing
to 0.10 %in the Andean group and 0.77 % in the Mesoamerican group. Haplotype
patterns spanning 310 Mb of the genome (60 %) were characterized in samples from 
different origins. However, the haplotype frameworks were under-represented for
the Andean (7.85 %) and Mesoamerican (5.55 %) gene pools separately. In
conclusion, RAD sequencing allowed the discovery of hundreds of useful SNPs for
broad genetic analysis of common bean germplasm. From now, this approach provides
an excellent panel of molecular tools for whole genome analysis, allowing
integrating and better exploring the common bean breeding practices.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is an important model system, which
has been widely used in plant physiological studies and it is particularly useful
as a bioreactor. Despite its importance, only limited molecular marker resources 
are available for genome analysis, genetic mapping and breeding. Restriction-site
associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) is a powerful new method for targeted
sequencing across the genomes of many individuals. This approach has broad
potential for genetic analysis through linkage mapping.
RESULTS: We constructed a RAD library using genomic DNA from a BC1 backcross
population. Sequencing of 196 individuals was performed on an Illumina
HiSeq 2500. Two linkage maps were constructed, one with a reference genome and
another, termed as de novo identification of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
by RAD-seq, without a reference genome. Overall, 4138 and 2162 SNP markers with a
total length of 1944.74 and 2000.9 cM were mapped to 24 linkage groups in the
genetic maps based on reference genome and without reference, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using two different SNP discovery methods based on next generation
RAD sequencing technology, we have respectively mapped 2162 and 4318 SNPs in our 
backcross population. This study gives an excellent example for high density
linkage map construction, irrespective of genome sequence availability, and
provides saturated information for downstream genetic investigations such as
quantitative trait locus analyses or genomic selection (e.g. bioreactor suitable 
cultivars).

Laying performance is an important economical trait of goose production. As
laying performance is of low heritability, it is of significance to develop a
marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategy for this trait. Definition of sequence
variation related to the target trait is a prerequisite of quantitating MAS, but 
little is presently known about the goose genome, which greatly hinders the
identification of genetic markers for the laying traits of geese. Recently
developed restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a possible approach
for discerning large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and reducing the 
complexity of a genome without having reference genomic information available. In
the present study, we developed a pooled RAD sequencing strategy for detecting
geese laying-related SNP. Two DNA pools were constructed, each consisting of
equal amounts of genomic DNA from 10 individuals with either high estimated
breeding value (HEBV) or low estimated breeding value (LEBV). A total of 139,013 
SNP were obtained from 42,291,356 sequences, of which 18,771,943 were for LEBV
and 23,519,413 were for HEBV cohorts. Fifty-five SNP which had different allelic 
frequencies in the two DNA pools were further validated by individual-based
AS-PCR genotyping in the LEBV and HEBV cohorts. Ten out of 55 SNP exhibited
distinct allele distributions in these two cohorts. These 10 SNP were further
genotyped in a goose population of 492 geese to verify the association with egg
numbers. The result showed that 8 of 10 SNP were associated with egg numbers.
Additionally, liner regression analysis revealed that SNP Record-111407, 106975
and 112359 were involved in a multiplegene network affecting laying performance. 
We used IPCR to extend the unknown regions flanking the candidate RAD tags. The
obtained sequences were subjected to BLAST to retrieve the orthologous genes in
either ducks or chickens. Five novel genes were cloned for geese which harbored
the candidate laying-related SNP, including membrane associated guanylate kinase 
(MAGI-1), KIAA1462, Rho GTPase activating protein 21 (ARHGAP21), acyl-CoA
synthetase family member 2 (ACSF2), astrotactin 2 (ASTN2). Collectively, our data
suggests that 8 SNP and 5 genes might be promising candidate markers or targets
for marker-assisted selection of egg numbers in geese.

BACKGROUND: Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) is a dioecious species that has a long
juvenility period. Therefore, development of marker-assisted selection (MAS)
techniques would greatly facilitate pistachio cultivar-breeding programs. The sex
determination mechanism is presently unknown in pistachio. The generation of
sex-linked markers is likely to reduce time, labor, and costs associated with
breeding programs, and will help to clarify the sex determination system in
pistachio.
RESULTS: Restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) markers were used to identify
sex-linked markers and to elucidate the sex determination system in pistachio.
Eight male and eight female F1 progenies from a Pistacia vera L. Siirt × Bağyolu 
cross, along with the parents, were subjected to RAD sequencing in two lanes of a
Hi-Seq 2000 sequencing platform. This generated 449 million reads, comprising
approximately 37.7 Gb of sequences. There were 33,757 polymorphic single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci between the parents. Thirty-eight of these,
from 28 RAD reads, were detected as putative sex-associated loci in pistachio.
Validation was performed by SNaPshot analysis in 42 mature F1 progenies and in
124 cultivars and genotypes in a germplasm collection. Eight loci could
distinguish sex with 100% accuracy in pistachio. To ascertain cost-effective
application of markers in a breeding program, high-resolution melting (HRM)
analysis was performed; four markers were found to perfectly separate sexes in
pistachio. Because of the female heterogamety in all candidate SNP loci, we
report for the first time that pistachio has a ZZ/ZW sex determination system. As
the reported female-to-male segregation ratio is 1:1 in all known segregating
populations and there is no previous report of super-female genotypes or female
heteromorphic chromosomes in pistachio, it appears that the WW genotype is not
viable.
CONCLUSION: Sex-linked SNP markers were identified and validated in a large
germplasm and proved their suitability for MAS in pistachio. HRM analysis
successfully validated the sex-linked markers for MAS. For the first time in
dioecious pistachio, a female heterogamety ZW/ZZ sex determination system is
suggested.

BACKGROUND: Ziziphus Mill. (jujube), the most valued genus of Rhamnaceae,
comprises of a number of economically and ecologically important species such as 
Z. jujuba Mill., Z. acidojujuba Cheng et Liu and Z. mauritiana Lam. Single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and a high-density genetic map are of great
benefit to the improvement of the crop, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and
analyzing genome structure. However, such a high-density map is still absent in
the genus Ziziphus and even the family Rhamnaceae. The recently developed
restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) marker has been proven to be most powerful 
in genetic map construction. The objective of this study was to construct a
high-density linkage map using the RAD tags generated by next generation
sequencing.
RESULTS: An interspecific F1 population and their parents (Z. jujuba Mill. 'JMS2'
× Z. acidojujuba Cheng et Liu 'Xing 16') were genotyped using a
mapping-by-sequencing approach, to generate RAD-based SNP markers. A total of
42,784 putative high quality SNPs were identified between the parents and 2,872
high-quality RAD markers were grouped in genetic maps. Of the 2,872 RAD markers, 
1,307 were linked to the female genetic map, 1,336 to the male map, and 2,748 to 
the integrated map spanning 913.87 centi-morgans (cM) with an average marker
interval of 0.34 cM. The integrated map contained 12 linkage groups (LGs),
consistent with the haploid chromosome number of the two parents.
CONCLUSION: We first generated a high-density genetic linkage map with 2,748 RAD 
markers for jujube and a large number of SNPs were also developed. It provides a 
useful tool for both marker-assisted breeding and a variety of genome
investigations in jujube, such as sequence assembly, gene localization, QTL
detection and genome structure comparison.

A high-resolution genetic map of sunflower was constructed by integrating SNP
data from three F2 mapping populations (HA 89/RHA 464, B-line/RHA 464, and CR
29/RHA 468). The consensus map spanned a total length of 1443.84 cM, and
consisted of 5,019 SNP markers derived from RAD tag sequencing and 118 publicly
available SSR markers distributed in 17 linkage groups, corresponding to the
haploid chromosome number of sunflower. The maximum interval between markers in
the consensus map is 12.37 cM and the average distance is 0.28 cM between
adjacent markers. Despite a few short-distance inversions in marker order, the
consensus map showed high levels of collinearity among individual maps with an
average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.972 across the genome. The
order of the SSR markers on the consensus map was also in agreement with the
order of the individual map and with previously published sunflower maps. Three
individual and one consensus maps revealed the uneven distribution of markers
across the genome. Additionally, we performed fine mapping and marker validation 
of the rust resistance gene R12, providing closely linked SNP markers for
marker-assisted selection of this gene in sunflower breeding programs. This high 
resolution consensus map will serve as a valuable tool to the sunflower community
for studying marker-trait association of important agronomic traits, marker
assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning, and comparative mapping.

The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer, 1837)) is a parasitic copepod 
that can, if untreated, cause considerable damage to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar
Linnaeus, 1758) and incurs significant costs to the Atlantic salmon mariculture
industry. Salmon lice are gonochoristic and normally show sex ratios close to
1:1. While this observation suggests that sex determination in salmon lice is
genetic, with only minor environmental influences, the mechanism of sex
determination in the salmon louse is unknown. This paper describes the
identification of a sex-linked Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) marker,
providing the first evidence for a genetic mechanism of sex determination in the 
salmon louse. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) was used to
isolate SNP markers in a laboratory-maintained salmon louse strain. A total of 85
million raw Illumina 100 base paired-end reads produced 281,838 unique RAD-tags
across 24 unrelated individuals. RAD marker Lsa101901 showed complete association
with phenotypic sex for all individuals analysed, being heterozygous in females
and homozygous in males. Using an allele-specific PCR assay for genotyping, this 
SNP association pattern was further confirmed for three unrelated salmon louse
strains, displaying complete association with phenotypic sex in a total of 96
genotyped individuals. The marker Lsa101901 was located in the coding region of
the prohibitin-2 gene, which showed a sex-dependent differential expression, with
mRNA levels determined by RT-qPCR about 1.8-fold higher in adult female than
adult male salmon lice. This study's observations of a novel sex-linked SNP
marker are consistent with sex determination in the salmon louse being genetic
and following a female heterozygous system. Marker Lsa101901 provides a tool to
determine the genetic sex of salmon lice, and could be useful in the development 
of control strategies.

BACKGROUND: Application of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) marker technology
as a tool in sunflower breeding programs offers enormous potential to improve
sunflower genetics, and facilitate faster release of sunflower hybrids to the
market place. Through a National Sunflower Association (NSA) funded initiative,
we report on the process of SNP discovery through reductive genome sequencing and
local assembly of six diverse sunflower inbred lines that represent oil as well
as confection types.
RESULTS: A combination of Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq)
protocols and Illumina paired-end sequencing chemistry generated high quality
89.4 M paired end reads from the six lines which represent 5.3 GB of the
sequencing data. Raw reads from the sunflower line, RHA 464 were assembled de
novo to serve as a framework reference genome. About 15.2 Mb of sunflower genome 
distributed over 42,267 contigs were obtained upon assembly of RHA 464 sequencing
data, the contig lengths ranged from 200 to 950 bp with an N50 length of 393 bp. 
SNP calling was performed by aligning sequencing data from the six sunflower
lines to the assembled reference RHA 464. On average, 1 SNP was located every
143 bp of the sunflower genome sequence. Based on several filtering criteria, a
final set of 16,467 putative sequence variants with characteristics favorable for
Illumina Infinium Genotyping Technology (IGT) were mined from the sequence data
generated across six diverse sunflower lines.
CONCLUSION: Here we report the molecular and computational methodology involved
in SNP development for a complex genome like sunflower lacking reference
assembly, offering an attractive tool for molecular breeding purposes in
sunflower.

Here, we present an adaptation of restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing
(RAD-seq) to the Illumina HiSeq2000 technology that we used to produce SNP
markers in very large quantities at low cost per unit in the Réunion grey
white-eye (Zosterops borbonicus), a nonmodel passerine bird species with no
reference genome. We sequenced a set of six pools of 18-25 individuals using a
single sequencing lane. This allowed us to build around 600 000 contigs, among
which at least 386 000 could be mapped to the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)
genome. This yielded more than 80 000 SNPs that could be mapped unambiguously and
are evenly distributed across the genome. Thus, our approach provides a good
illustration of the high potential of paired-end RAD sequencing of pooled DNA
samples combined with comparative assembly to the zebra finch genome to build
large contigs and characterize vast numbers of informative SNPs in nonmodel
passerine bird species in a very efficient and cost-effective way.

Phylogenetic relationships among temperate species of bamboo are difficult to
resolve, owing to both the challenge of detecting sufficiently variable markers
and their polyploid history. Here, we use restriction site-associated DNA
sequencing to identify candidate loci with fixed allelic differences segregating 
between and within two temperate species of bamboos: Arundinaria faberi and
Yushania brevipaniculata. Approximately 27 million paired-end sequencing reads
were generated across four samples. From pooled data, we assembled 67 685 and
70 668 de novo contigs from partial overlap among paired-end reads, with an
average length of 240 and 241 bp for the two species, respectively, which were
used to investigate functional classification of RAD tags in a blastx search.
Analysed separately by population, we recovered 29 443 putatively orthologous RAD
tags shared across the four sampled populations, containing 28 023 sequence
variants, of which c. 13 000 are segregating between species, and c. 3000
segregating between populations within each species. Analyses based on these RAD 
tags yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data set constructed from 
surprisingly few loci. This study illustrates the potential for
reduced-representation genome data to resolve difficult phylogenetic
relationships in temperate bamboos.

Caviar-producing sturgeons belonging to the genus Acipenser are considered to be 
one of the most endangered species groups in the world. Continued overfishing in 
spite of increasing legislation, zero catch quotas and extensive aquaculture
production have led to the collapse of wild stocks across Europe and Asia. The
evolutionary relationships among Adriatic, Russian, Persian and Siberian
sturgeons are complex because of past introgression events and remain poorly
understood. Conservation management, traceability and enforcement suffer a lack
of appropriate DNA markers for the genetic identification of sturgeon at the
species, population and individual level. This study employed RAD sequencing to
discover and characterize single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA markers for
use in sturgeon conservation in these four tetraploid species over three
biological levels, using a single sequencing lane. Four population meta-samples
and eight individual samples from one family were barcoded separately before
sequencing. Analysis of 14.4 Gb of paired-end RAD data focused on the
identification of SNPs in the paired-end contig, with subsequent in silico and
empirical validation of candidate markers. Thousands of putatively informative
markers were identified including, for the first time, SNPs that show
population-wide differentiation between Russian and Persian sturgeons,
representing an important advance in our ability to manage these cryptic species.
The results highlight the challenges of genotyping-by-sequencing in polyploid
taxa, while establishing the potential genetic resources for developing a new
range of caviar traceability and enforcement tools.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs are rapidly replacing anonymous markers in
population genomic studies, but their use in non model organisms is hampered by
the scarcity of cost-effective approaches to uncover genome-wide variation in a
comprehensive subset of individuals. The screening of one or only a few
individuals induces ascertainment bias. To discover SNPs for a population genomic
study of the Pyrenean rocket (Sisymbrium austriacum subsp. chrysanthum), we
undertook a pooled RAD-PE (Restriction site Associated DNA Paired-End sequencing)
approach. RAD tags were generated from the PstI-digested pooled genomic DNA of 12
individuals sampled across the species distribution range and paired-end
sequenced using Illumina technology to produce ~24.5 Mb of sequences, covering
~7% of the specie's genome. Sequences were assembled into ~76 000 contigs with a 
mean length of 323 bp (N(50)  = 357 bp, sequencing depth = 24x). In all, >15 000 
SNPs were called, of which 47% were annotated in putative genic regions based on 
homology with the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Gene ontology (GO) slim
categorization demonstrated that the identified SNPs covered extant genic
variation well. The validation of 300 SNPs on a larger set of individuals using a
KASPar assay underpinned the utility of pooled RAD-PE as an inexpensive
genome-wide SNP discovery technique (success rate: 87%). In addition to SNPs, we 
discovered >600 putative SSR markers.

Hybridization with introduced rainbow trout threatens most native westslope
cutthroat trout populations. Understanding the genetic effects of hybridization
and introgression requires a large set of high-throughput, diagnostic genetic
markers to inform conservation and management. Recently, we identified several
thousand candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on RAD
sequencing of 11 westslope cutthroat trout and 13 rainbow trout individuals.
Here, we used flanking sequence for 56 of these candidate SNP markers to design
high-throughput genotyping assays. We validated the assays on a total of 92
individuals from 22 populations and seven hatchery strains. Forty-six assays
(82%) amplified consistently and allowed easy identification of westslope
cutthroat and rainbow trout alleles as well as heterozygote controls. The 46 SNPs
will provide high power for early detection of population admixture and improved 
identification of hybrid and nonhybridized individuals. This technique shows
promise as a very low-cost, reliable and relatively rapid method for developing
and testing SNP markers for nonmodel organisms with limited genomic resources.

RAD paired-end sequencing for local de novo assembly and SNP discovery in
non-model organisms.

Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) markers are rapidly becoming a standard for
SNP discovery and genotyping studies even in organisms without a sequenced
reference genome. It is difficult, however, to identify genes nearby RAD markers 
of interest or move from SNPs identified by RAD to a high-throughput genotyping
assay. Paired-end sequencing of RAD fragments can alleviate these problems by
generating a set of paired sequences that can be locally assembled into
high-quality contigs up to 1 kb in length. These contigs can then be used for SNP
identification, homology searching, or high-throughput assay primer design. In
this chapter, we offer suggestions on how to design a RAD paired-end (RAD-PE)
sequencing project and the protocol for creating paired-end RAD libraries
suitable for Illumina sequencers.

BACKGROUND: The globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus L. var. scolymus) genome is
relatively poorly explored, especially compared to those of the other major
Asteraceae crops sunflower and lettuce. No SNP markers are in the public domain. 
We have combined the recently developed restriction-site associated DNA (RAD)
approach with the Illumina DNA sequencing platform to effect the rapid and mass
discovery of SNP markers for C. cardunculus.
RESULTS: RAD tags were sequenced from the genomic DNA of three C. cardunculus
mapping population parents, generating 9.7 million reads, corresponding to ~1 Gbp
of sequence. An assembly based on paired ends produced ~6.0 Mbp of genomic
sequence, separated into ~19,000 contigs (mean length 312 bp), of which ~21% were
fragments of putative coding sequence. The shared sequences allowed for the
discovery of ~34,000 SNPs and nearly 800 indels, equivalent to a SNP frequency of
5.6 per 1,000 nt, and an indel frequency of 0.2 per 1,000 nt. A sample of
heterozygous SNP loci was mapped by CAPS assays and this exercise provided
validation of our mining criteria. The repetitive fraction of the genome had a
high representation of retrotransposon sequence, followed by simple repeats,
AT-low complexity regions and mobile DNA elements. The genomic k-mers
distribution and CpG rate of C. cardunculus, compared with data derived from
three whole genome-sequenced dicots species, provided a further evidence of the
random representation of the C. cardunculus genome generated by RAD sampling.
CONCLUSION: The RAD tag sequencing approach is a cost-effective and rapid method 
to develop SNP markers in a highly heterozygous species. Our approach permitted
to generate a large and robust SNP datasets by the adoption of optimized
filtering criteria.

Next-generation sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the field of
evolutionary biology, opening the possibility for genetic analysis at scales not 
previously possible. Research in population genetics, quantitative trait mapping,
comparative genomics, and phylogeography that was unthinkable even a few years
ago is now possible. More importantly, these next-generation sequencing studies
can be performed in organisms for which few genomic resources presently exist. To
speed this revolution in evolutionary genetics, we have developed Restriction
site Associated DNA (RAD) genotyping, a method that uses Illumina next-generation
sequencing to simultaneously discover and score tens to hundreds of thousands of 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in hundreds of individuals for
minimal investment of resources. In this chapter, we describe the core RAD-seq
protocol, which can be modified to suit a diversity of evolutionary genetic
questions. In addition, we discuss bioinformatic considerations that arise from
unique aspects of next-generation sequencing data as compared to traditional
marker-based approaches, and we outline some general analytical approaches for
RAD-seq and similar data. Despite considerable progress, the development of
analytical tools remains in its infancy, and further work is needed to fully
quantify sampling variance and biases in these data types.

BACKGROUND: The eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) genome is relatively unexplored, 
especially compared to those of the other major Solanaceae crops tomato and
potato. In particular, no SNP markers are publicly available; on the other hand, 
over 1,000 SSR markers were developed and publicly available. We have combined
the recently developed Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) approach with
Illumina DNA sequencing for rapid and mass discovery of both SNP and SSR markers 
for eggplant.
RESULTS: RAD tags were generated from the genomic DNA of a pair of eggplant
mapping parents, and sequenced to produce ~17.5 Mb of sequences arrangeable into 
~78,000 contigs. The resulting non-redundant genomic sequence dataset consisted
of ~45,000 sequences, of which ~29% were putative coding sequences and ~70% were 
in common between the mapping parents. The shared sequences allowed the discovery
of ~10,000 SNPs and nearly 1,000 indels, equivalent to a SNP frequency of 0.8 per
Kb and an indel frequency of 0.07 per Kb. Over 2,000 of the SNPs are likely to be
mappable via the Illumina GoldenGate assay. A subset of 384 SNPs was used to
successfully fingerprint a panel of eggplant germplasm, producing a set of
informative diversity data. The RAD sequences also included nearly 2,000 putative
SSRs, and primer pairs were designed to amplify 1,155 loci.
CONCLUSION: The high throughput sequencing of the RAD tags allowed the discovery 
of a large number of DNA markers, which will prove useful for extending our
current knowledge of the genome organization of eggplant, for assisting in
marker-aided selection and for carrying out comparative genomic analyses within
the Solanaceae family.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and genotyping are essential to
genetic mapping. There remains a need for a simple, inexpensive platform that
allows high-density SNP discovery and genotyping in large populations. Here we
describe the sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) tags, which
identified more than 13,000 SNPs, and mapped three traits in two model organisms,
using less than half the capacity of one Illumina sequencing run. We demonstrated
that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. 
Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine
mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by
identifying recombinant breakpoints in F(2) individuals. Barcoding also
facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in
silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD
sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced
mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated
platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely
applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.
